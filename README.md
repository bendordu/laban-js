## Inspiration
The coronavirus pandemic caused people to isolate themselves.
A long stay at home causes a problem of low mobility, physical and mental health weakness.
Physical exercises could help in this matter.
However, the uniformity of exercises in a confined space can also adversely affect the mental state.
Unlike fitness and other usual physical activities, dance improvisation involves research work aimed at studying the relationships in the body.
One square meter is required for the lessons.

## What it does
The program uses the improvisation method of Rudolf von Laban to introduce a person to his body.

How we built it
To create an application, Python script is created using PyGame library.
Using a popular programming language will allow other contributors to join the writing of open source software.
As a result of work on the project, we want to get a ready-made working application
that will generate the necessary sequence of actions for dance improvisation controlled by a speech synthesizer.

What's next for Laban
Now the [original program](https://github.com/techandtech/laban) is only available on the local computer as a console application.
The task is to create a web site to make it available to other people.
