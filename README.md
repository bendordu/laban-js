# laban-js

This open source project is part of [The Global hack](https://theglobalhack.com/) online-event. For information about current state of coding please look [project wiki](https://github.com/matyushkin/laban-js/wiki).

## Inspiration
The coronavirus pandemic caused people to isolate themselves. A long stay at home causes a problem of low mobility, physical and mental health weakness. Physical exercises could help in this matter. However, the uniformity of exercises in a confined space can also adversely affect the mental state. Unlike fitness and other usual physical activities, dance improvisation involves research work aimed at studying the relationships in the body. One square meter is required for the lessons.

## What it does
The program uses the improvisation method by [Rudolf von Laban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudolf_von_Laban) to introduce a person to his body. Three input-forms represent the input data: 1) a combination of codes from Laban system (a string of numbers), 2) the number of repetitions), 3) delay time in seconds for rest between dance actions. A button under these forms controls the output. When you click on the button, the audiofiles sequence starts to play. This audio files are comands ot virtual trainer. Some illustrations may also be displayed for a better experience.

Short YouTube video to understand what Laban Movement is:

## How we built it
Using a popular programming language will allow other contributors to join the writing of open source software.
As a result of work on the project, we want to get a ready-made working application
that will generate the necessary sequence of actions for dance improvisation controlled by a speech synthesizer.
Now the [original program](https://github.com/techandtech/laban) is only available on the local computer as a console application. The task is to create a web site to make it available to other people. Now we use only HTML, CSS and JavaScript to make demo-application on website. 

## What's next for Laban
At further development of the project, we can develope backend-part: a) users can register to save training data, b) view their results, c) can be awarded for their achievements and d) receive personalized recommendations for improving dance technique.
